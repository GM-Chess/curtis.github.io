						I attend York University, where I study electrical engineering. I'm passionate about learning, developing firmware and robotics. As part of the York University Robotics Society, I am currently developing firmware for a microcontroller that will serve multiple purposes for a Mars rover.

											Microcontrollers are the foundation of an embedded system. I created an array keyboard with an XMC4500 microcontroller development board. This MCU has an ARM Cortex-M4 
                                            the processor on it, which allowed me to excel in the ARM Cortex instruction set. I program the MCU with C in the DAVE V4, an Infineon IDE. The project improved my 
                                            embedded C knowladge because I used SysTic Interrupts and pull-up/down switches. For my code, please visit my GitHub 
                                        </p>

									The second project I would like to highlight is from my 2003 class. We had to use proper technical engineering communication. 
                                    The topic I chose was ethics in artificial intelligence (AI). I choose this topic as it is crucial for big corporations to demonstrate good ethical practices.
                                    Next, I created a machine learning(ML) algorithm to highlight the biases in ML. I manipulated the data to show that algorithm training can lead to discrimination.
									As I hypothesised the data used to train a algorithm blatantly effects bias during testing. Please visit my GitHub to view the code, report, and figures.

											In my Engineering 2003 class, we had another exciting task: communicating a technical topic from a top-level and in-depth view. To do this, I created two 
											separate pamphlets, one for high school students who might not have as much knowledge and someone who may be in their fourth year with more knowledge. The 
											topic for this project is the same as my report, ethics in AI. After reflecting on this project, I improved my technical skills substantially as I realized
											that it is vital to understand your audience. Knowing my audience allowed me to break down the information in an easier-to-understand way for the high school 
											students. To view the pamphlets, please click <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14-hrIJbeioFUOJWJmcYAagjVkL38_d2GS7MwCyOCItU/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a>

											For my Engineering 2003 class, I was on a team to create a group project. For this group project, we had to create and record a presentation. Our presentation
											was on the ethics of self-driving. The topic of ethics with self-driving cars was interesting and exciting to talk about in a group setting. My group of 4 was
											very diverse, with various individuals and disciplines. The diversity brought plenty of excellent ideas that fueled the brilliance and creativity of our project.
											As a result, our project excelled and received an A. In addition, it was a great way to improve my teamwork and communication skills. To veiw the slide show go
